Ansible:

it is one of the configuration management tool to manage the entire infrastructure level we use.

Architecture:

in ansible we have 2 components

Ansible server
Ansible nodes

there will be no workstation in asible like chef we implement everything in ansible server.

in ansible we write in yml language thos were stored with name called playbooks.

we execute play books in ansible server those will connect to node servers.

Ansible is called agentless configuration tool


it works on ssh no need of ansibe agent


now go to aws console and launch two ubuntu/red instances with same configuration

one insantce name it as master other instance name it as Node. 

now login to master server go this path 

vi /etc/hosts

copy node private ip address and paste in above path   (  172.31.21.28   node1.local node1)  node.local just .com ie fqdn ( fullu qualified domain name)

now check with command (  ping node1) the network connections will flow.

but here we have to login like these using ssh

#ssh root@node1 ( if u use this command u will defineltly get error)

so we have to set password less authentication  to connect from master to node server

now in master server type these commands

 # ssh-keygen ( type this comnd and click on eneter  and eneter and enter it will generate one key)

now type cmnd

# ls -al ( u will find hidden files and nornal files and directories in that u will find .SSH directory)

# cd .ssh
# ls -al
u will find some keys named as

id_rsa and id_ras.pub those are public and private keys

# cat id_rsa.pub   ( u will find public key copy that entire lines in master serever u will find file name called authorised keys)

# vi authorised keys
paste the public key in that authorised keys file .

Now go to node servr

# ls -al  cd .ssh ( u will find authorised key file)

paste same public key file copied from master server in this node server in authorised key file.

Now go to master server check with command r u able to login from mastr to node server or not with the command

#  ssh root@node1  

must and should python3 must be installed in servers

check with command # python3 --version  if u find python leave it else install with command # apt install python3

go to this link and install ansible in ur master server

https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.3/intro_installation.html#latest-releases-via-apt-ubuntu  or follow below commands

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km3BCQnV6sw-ANSIBLE INSTALLATION VIDEO

MASTER WORK
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt install software-properties-common
$ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt-get install ansible

NODE/SLAVE WORK

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt install python

once done check with command

#  ansible --version

now go to this locations and do some modifications

# vi /etc/ansible/hosts

add node private ip address and master as localhost

 # vi /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

find the line  ( host_key_checking) that will be true make it as false and remove # mark

Find the line ( deprecation _warnings) this will be true make it as false and remove # mark

now save file 

now we shld create inventory files and we shld write which servrs u r mnanaging

vi ans_hosts

[allservers]
localhost
node1

[clients]
node1

now save the file and check with command is our master server is connecting to node servers

# ansible -i ans_hosts all -m ping

how to check free space or uptime or some others usind ansible adhoc commands?

ansible -i ans_hosts node1 -a "free -h"   (  ans_host means where u kept ur node servers list node1 means to which servr u r finding free space and the last fre -m or h is command)

ansible-playbook play1.yml -i ans_hosts --syntax-check   ( this will check playbook syntax if any issue in pb it will show)
   60  ansible-playbook play1.yml -i ans_hosts --check  
   61  ansible-playbook play1.yml -i ans_hosts --list-hosts
   62  ansible-playbook play1.yml -i ans_hosts --check -v
   63  ansible-playbook play1.yml -i ans_hosts --v
   64  ansible-playbook play1.yml -i ans_hosts --all
   65  ansible-playbook play1.yml -i ans_hosts ( this is for installation)
