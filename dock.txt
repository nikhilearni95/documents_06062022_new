https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04 

after installation of docker we can exceute some comands to chek whether is working fine or not

docker images ( to check images)

docker ps ( to check any containers running)

how to pull image in to docker ?
for that just login to dockerhub.com or hub.docker.com

signup the page there dicker id means any name u can give

select free option and search for images in that site

if u search for hello-world image u will find many images for thre u can copy and paste in server

ex: docker pull hello-world 
else if u want to search in server with that helolo world image

docker search hello-world
u will find all star ratings images from that also u can slect

now ifu want to pull that image to ur server/machine just do

docker pull hello-world
now if u check docker images u will fimd all deatils
how to rrun a container?
docker run -itd -p 81:80 hell0-world
now check docker ps ( u will find conatiner info)

to chec k whethrt it is running in web 
ur ip adrress :81 ( in my case port is 81)
to stop container
docker stop containerid     ( docker stop 65190bed0dad and to start docker start 65190bed0dad)

to check stopped container or all conatiners list 
docker ps -a
to download linux images 
docker pull centos

docker run -it centos ( we will jump in to container) 
now tpe hostname u will see container id
now from container if u wnat to come out type exit and check docker ps -a u will find cotainer is stopped and exited but fron that container only if u type
ctrl pq  ( u will exited from that container and now if u check docker ps -a it will keep on running)
if u want to install any pkg in contaier move to that conatiner and install

i wana install git ( yum install git -y)
yum install wget
to jump in to running container
docker attach <containerid>
can we connect to stopped conatiners?
no we cannot we have to start conatiner and sand then connect

now if u want to download any image u will dowload in to machines and run it
for ex: if u don't have ubuntu image in ur machine but if u run this command 
(docker run -it ubuntu) it will connect to dockerhub and check with this name sny latest images if it is tere it will downlaod

now u can install whaht evr pkg u want in ubuntu like git

to jump in to running container we can use this commanda also

docker exec -it <cont id> </bin/bash>

docker exec -it 2jj3j4j /bin bash ( for ex) this will take u to conatiner now if u do exit from this container u will container keep on running
how to remove a conatiner from ur machine?
docker rm <contid>
how to remove running conatiner ?
generaly we can't remove running container but if u want to remove u have to use force option
docker rm -f <containid>
to list only conayiner id's
docker ps -aq
how to delete images from ur machine
docker rmi <imageid>
i want to create container but i should not enter in to that it shls be back on running
docker run -itd centos

how to create a image from existing conatiner?
if we create like this all info like pkgs everthing in the old cont will automatically move to that image from image we can create new container

docker commit <conrid>

if u want to create any tagname for ur images
docker tag 5d7dcab789ff<imageid> "testimg"<tagname>

how to push image from ur machine to dokcer hub?
go to dockerhub and click on repositries and create new repo add details and create

must and shld imagname and repo name shld be same to push our image to dickerhub
docker tag 5d7dcab789ff krishkal/testimg
now u will see duplicate image u can delete  that duplicate image
docker rmi <imagname>
now login to docker hub from ur machine usig this commanf
docker login ( give creds)
now to push in to dockerhub repo
docker push krishkal/testimg
u will find in dockerhub.com ur project


Docker volume:

how do you transfer files from container to host machine in docker?

$ docker cp (container_id):/(files from which place to copy) /hostfile  

how do you transfer files from host machine to cotainer in docker?

$ docker cp /hostfile  (container_id):/(to_the_place_you_want_the_file_to_be) or

docker run -itd -v path:path imagename

ex: docker run -itd -v /opt/sai:/opt centos

we can also check files by deleting from host machine and from container if we delete in host machine it will be automatically deleted from conainer as it is shared drive
how to transfer dat from host machine to existing container?
docker run -it -v /opt/seetha/:/opt/ f63181f19b2f

how to share data between container to container?
docker run -itd --volumes-from d018f1ab0ad1 centos ( it will create new container and pull data from old to new cid)

how to build a image on your own not from docker hub?
just go to any path in host machine
cd /opt thre create one directory and then create one filename in that dir
touch Dockerfile ( file name shld be Dockerfile only)
vi Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu (which image u want to run)
MAINTAINER krishna
RUN apt-get update -y
RUN mkdir /opt/venkat
now save it
docker build -t "testimgfile:ubuntu" . ( in my case testimgfile that image name and ubuntu is tage name)


Docker commands:

docker info ( it displays information like how many cinatiner and images all etc)

if u want to know particular container details
docker inspect <contid>

how to check container logs?

docker logs <contid>
to check images history?

docker history <imagename>

how to kill contid?

docker kill <contid> both kill or stop are same

docker ps -l ( it shows latest container information)

docker restart <contid> ( it will restart ur container)

docker pause <contid> ( cont will be paused that means it will be running only but wecan't connect to that container)

docker unpause <contid> ( it will unpause cont>

how to rename container name?

docker rename <existingname> <newname>

how to change name while creating container only?

docker run -itd --name seesai ubuntu  ( in my case sesai is my container name and ubuntu is new container)

how to pull and run web server in docker?

docker pull nginx
docker run -itd --name testnginx -p 82:80 nginx ( in my case i named it as testnginx and 80 is default port number and 82 is my port number which i set it)

docker stats <contid> ( it showslike top comnd)

how to create network in docker?

open one dupliucate section and pull wordpress images

docker pull wordpress
docker pull mysql:5.7
dokcer network list ( it will show default n/w's)
docker inspect networkid ( it will display full info about that network)

docker network create --subnet 10.1.0.0/16 --gateway 10.1.0.1 --ip-range 10.1.5.0/24 --driver bridge --label test-network bridge1 ( in my case bridge1 is my n/w name)

docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq) ( this will remove all containers rnning or stopped)

docker run -it --net bridge1 centos ( in y case i'm running container in my own network) ( in this case if u don't provide ur networkname it will create in default n/w)
now check hostname -i ( u will find ip range of that container)


docker network rm b48ff4261ebc ( it will remove netowork)

Docker link?

how do you link webapplication container and mqsql container ? ( this is senario question)

for that we have download any webapp and datebase  ( in my case i have downloaded wordpress and mqsql:5.7)

 docker run -itd -p 83:80 wordpress

docker run -itd --name mydb -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=12345 mysql:5.7

docker run -itd --name wp -p 82:80 --link mydb:mqsql wordpress

my troubleshoot

creating container 

docker run -d --name tomcat-container -p 8081:8080 tomcat

jump into container

docker exec -it tomcat-container /bin/bash

copy files

cp -R * ../webapps

create docker file

FROM tomcat:latest
RUN cp -R /usr/local/tomcat/webapps.dist/* /usr/local/tomcat/webapps

how to integrate docker to jenkins?

first you have to check the groups in your instance for that enter below one

cat /etc/group

and then you find a group called docker

now we have to create a user and add him to the docker group
for that please follow below steps

useradd dockeradmin
passwd dockeradmin

adding dockeradmin to docker group

usermod -aG docker dockeradmin

login to dockeradimn

open duplicate session

it is not allowed password based authentication for that you have to change the password authentication

follow below methods

vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
in this search for passwords
/Password

now you have to uncomment password authentiocation:yes
and comment password authentication:no

and save it :wq!

now you have open duplicate sesssion and login as dockeradmin and enter your password

now come to your jenkins server and install plugin called publish over ssh

and click on system configuration scroll down to bottom and  you will find publish over SSH

and click on add
and enter name
	hostname : privateip address
	username :
click on advanced and enter password
and run test configuration
and save.
now your dockeradmin integrated to jenkins.

give files or directories permissions to the dockeradmin

chown -R dockeradmin:dockeradmin docker

login to container image using ip address
https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/221




docker system prune--images and container gone will be deleted

docker images prune---images will be deleted

docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)--all container stop

docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)--all containers delete


*******************JENKINS INTEGRATION WITH DOCKER***************

sudo usermod -a -G docker jenkins

reboot

then in pipeline, docker commands work like building images and running containers
