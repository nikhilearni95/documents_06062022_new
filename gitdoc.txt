Git document

if we are using linux use ubuntu or redhat

for ubuntu to install git in ur server

apt update,  apt-get install git   yum

now create a directory in server and jump in to that

mkdir project  , cd project


so we have to initilaize that git directory

git init

we have three stages in git 

working dir ( ie ur directory naeme)

stage/cache ( hidden)
local_repo ( hidden)

we will move files from working dir to local repo to access files

first configure ur git file

we have 3 levels for configuraton

1    system
     /etc/gitconfig
        git config --system

2   user
   ~/.gitconfig
   git config --global

3 project
  .git/config
  git config

in real time we will use user level configuration;

git config --global user.name "krish"

git config --global user.email "xxxx@gmail.com"

git config --global core.editor "vi"

git config --global color.ui true  ( just to know phases color in which phase u r this optinoal)

to list what configurations u have done

git config --list

to check status of ur files
git status
now create one file in side  that directry and do git satus we will find it as in red color so that means it is woring dir

now we have to move that file to stage/cache directort

git add <filename>

now check git  status u will find in green color

now w ehave commit the file it will go to local repo so that we will know what chnages done we will write thre

git commit -m "this is index file"

to check commited file
git log ( we will get some commit number commit a4242b686fe812dabfd22a31f0bf2ac80b09a94d this are versions number

to show ur commited messgae in git 

git show  a4242b686fe812dabfd22a31f0bf2ac80b09a94d  ( u will see ur file content what u have saved)

for ex: root@ip-172-31-2-34:~/project# git show a4242b686fe812dabfd22a31f0bf2ac80b09a94d                                                                                        commit a4242b686fe812dabfd22a31f0bf2ac80b09a94d (HEAD -> master)

+hi this is test file


to  add multiple files at a time in git first create some emplty files

touch s1 s2 s3 s4 

to add these files ata atime use cmnd ( git add .) so that it will add all files at a time

git commit -m " thse are my new files"

git wont dtect empty directories

to check full commit in single line
git log --oneline ( it will show all commites in single line)
git log --until-2020-10-02 ( this will show files until this date)
git log --since-2017 -10-02 ( this will show since files from that date)
git log --author="sai" ( this wil show author related files)
git log --grep ="s1" ( this will show what has modifiled to that file)
git diff a4242b6 b4b9fe9 ( this will show diff b/w commits)
=========================================================================================================================
what are branches?
it is collection of commits

we will have master branch in that we ont do any work 

master           project1 ( this                    project2(another project)
index +extra     index+extra+additional       c, php

so here we will write code in thse projects and finaly push or merge to master branch

when ever u create branch what ever master have existing content that will come to newly crared branch

git branch ( it will show current branches)

how to create new branch

git branch <new branch name>

git branch <f1>
to move from one branch to other branch ( git checkout <branch name>)

to create branch and checkout to that branch in one line?

git checkout -b <new branch name>
now if u see content what ever master have newly created branches also will have same comtent

to see diff between branches 

git diff f1 f2

how to merge two branches?

in what ever brach u wana merger u shld be in that  branch and merger

for ex: i wana merge my f1 to master branch so u have to be in master brch

cmnd: git merge f1

if u wana delete any branch 

git branch -d f1 ( u shld ne in other brach and delete this branch)

git branch -D f1 ( this is force full deletiuon)

=======================================================
git rm and git mv

how to add and commiot a file or dir in single step?

git commit -am <"commit name">

this is for existing files only

how to delete a file?

how to get back deleted file?
git checkout <filename>

how to delete a file pemanently in all three phases?

Hw to erase history?
git reset --soft <commit num> this will delete files in local repo
git reset --mixed <commit num> this will delete in both local and stage
git reset --hard <commit num> this will delete in all phases

what is stash?

stash is temporary area under git

why stash?

to store temporary files

the files must be in stage/cache area

what are commands to store the data in stash?

git stash save <"message">
how to see stash list?
git stash list
what are commands use to copy data in to branches?
git stash apply <stash#> ..copy and paste to branches wat particluar branch u want
git stash pop  <stash#> ..cut and paste same as above
