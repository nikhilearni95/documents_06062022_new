now if u chk in home page u will find s lette ( means status of that job it is built or not) and w ( weather report of last five succesiive builds and unsuccessive builds)

last u will find sysmbol click on that it build the job so that u can find that job is successfully built as tick mark and status as success

we can build same job as many times u want so that u can fins in optin last success time and #2 no of builds #2 means two times i have builded that job.

now click on job name u will find no builds in build history if u want u can build that job again with option build now.

now wantedly fail the job just go to configure and select build optin and select windows execute batch optin and save it.

now build the job it will automaticall fail do some bilds and check weather report u will find sun wit cloud and thunders and raining so all these indicate jobs got failed.

we can check logs also for these jobs so just go to build history and click on tick mark u will find logs and for failed jobs also click on cross symbol u will find logs why it is failed.

to again build code in sample one click on configure ans select build andselect execute shell ( for linux select execute shell for windows select execute batch)

how to create new user in jenkins?
click on manage jenkins there u willfind manage users in that click on create users , create how many no of users u want no limit for that

what is executor status& build que?
by default we have two jobs called idle that means if u build 5jobs at atime 2jobs will go to build executor and remaining 3 jobs will be in build que so once one job
compltes in build executor automatically 3rd job will go from build que to executor.

now lets go to manage jenkins option in dash borad?

here we will have many options

configure system: to conifgure our email notifications and we can change executors count here and  we can know about jenkins home page

global tool configuration: to configue our tools we use this like ex: git , java ..etc

manage plugins: installations snd uninstallations of plugins we use this
 manage nodesand clouds: 

security

configure global security: wht ever permisions u wana give to users it will be thre in security.



now we will see each optin detailedly?


configure system:   Home directory:  here u will find jenikins path in linux

System mesg: u can provide some mesg there it is optional

# executors: herewe can increase no of executors and build jobs but here jenkins server will hang due to that 

label:
usage: will see when slaves conceptcomes

quite period: time difference b/w build and build

scm checkout retry count: for ex we have dev and github and jenkisn server. if dev team pushes code to github and in jenkins  if we keep scm chkout number is 2 that means
for every 2 mins of time jenins will go to github and chk if any new builds if any new code it will build else it wont


now go to manage plugins option

here we will find 4 optins

updates  it will show updatesofplugins
available it will show availale plugins in jenkins
installed it will show installed plugins
advanced  : it isnot recomended until if u r expert in any scripting

now lets jump in to security

in configure global security we have option called allow users to sign up if we allow that outside users can sign up and use our jenkins dashboard. so we shld not enable that.


in ths security we have two options one is authenticationa and other is authorisation

authentication means where we can create anyusers .etc authorisatio means where we can give access to those created users.

in authorisation if we enable on Any one can do any thing .not only we all users can do any thing in jenkins.so it shld not be enabled.

please do not enable legacy mode it will chnage all admin permissions
by default logged users can do any thing shldbe enable.

we have 3 types securtiys

matrix based security: giving differnt types of permissions to individualusers is called matrix based security.those users might be any team dev, or testing..etc


project based security:  to allocate spedific user to specifi project is called project based.


roll based strategy: it just like grps in our aws iam we will create grps and users to this grp and will give permissions to this grp. so that all users in those grps 
will get those permissions.

role bases strategy plugin we have to install it wnt be available in secuity tab.

now go to security and check in authorisation roll based is aded or not.

when u select matrix based first add admin user and give all permisions to that admin user.now if u want add how many no of users u want u can add and give whatever
permissions.

in project based as discussed we will give permissions to those particluar jobs/project to that particular user.

in security select project based and give first give admin permissions and then add user and give permission and now go to jons click on job and click on configure option
and add user and give permissions u want.

As we know roll based startegy is just like our awsiam creating grps and adding users to this grp.
select role based in secutiy and save it.mow click on manage and assign roles in that click on manage roles and add ur grp names ( test , dev etc) save it.

now click o assighn roles and add users to that grp.
