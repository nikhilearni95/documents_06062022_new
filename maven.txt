what is application build tool?
which will help to develop an application

why maven neded?
to build an java application

eg:

.java .....>.class
source       target/executable
what is compiler?
it is s/w which will help to convert high level language to low level languag

java file .....> .class file

10java files ...> 10.class files

.java ...> .class(bundle) ...>.jar(bundle) ...>war
group of .class files is called .jar file (java archieve>

group of .jar files is called .war file ( web archieve)
.ear ...> enter prise web archieve 

pre requisites for maven:

java ....> yum -y install java-1.8.0-openjdk

javac ...> yum -y install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel

maven uses pom.xml(project object modules) to define the project and its depencies.it helps to buid the structure of the project.
it also associate the files and help to build the application

how to download maven and install it?
go to this site (https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

copy link address of latest maven bin.tar.gz file in our case this is new version of maven
apache-maven-3.6.3-bin.tar.gz 

using wget comand we have to dowload maven

wget https://mirrors.estointernet.in/apache/maven/maven-3/3.8.4/binaries/apache-maven-3.8.4-bin.tar.gz

now gunzip the tar
gunzip apache-maven-3.8.4-bin.tar.gz

aptinstall maven    -for linux

extract the tar
 tar -xvf apache-maven-3.8.4-bin.tar.gz

vi /etc/profile.d/maven.sh

we have set env variables and mvn path
export M2_HOME=/home/ec2-user/apache-maven-3.8.4
export PATH=$PATH:$M2_HOME/bin

source /etc/profile.d/maven.sh

in my case maven is extracted in /home/ec2-user
nowif u chk mvn -version u will c versionof mvn

in home directory u will find (.bash_profile) this file copy those export commands to in this bash profile
and save it .so that if u exit from this server and again login u need not nter those export paths comnds
===============================================================

maven cmnds:

mvn archetype:generate ( it will give project structure)
mvn validate  (it will validate project structure)
mvn compile ( it will convrt .java files in to .class files)
mvn test ( it will test .class files)
mvn package (it helps to create .jar , .war, .ear)
mvn install ( it will install package locally)
mvn deploy ( it install package remotely)

createa a .jar file using 
1 mvn archetype:generate
 project num: ( in my case it is 1199)
group id: techproject
artifact id: simplejar ( inmy case u can keep what ever name u wamnt)
package id: same as group id
version: 1.0snapshot
now list u will find simpejar directory in that we will have projetc structure
if u see in that simple jar dir u will find pom.xml file ( while maintains entire structure of project)

2 mvn validate ( to use this comand u shld be in project structure only (simplejar)
3 mvn compile
4 mvn test
5 mvn package
to see content in .jar file after package comand
jar -tvf target/simplejar-1.0..snap

java -cp target/simplejar-1.0-snap.jar-techi.app

if u change any thing in code again u have  to validate compile test...all these

so to avoid these we will use jenkins
