Case - 1


Fork Project - https://github.com/ravi2krishna/project.git
https://github.com/yourname/project.git	
Dockerfile
Ansible Playbook
Jenkinsfile
Kubernetes files
	
Construct Pipeline - Jenkins  
- With CODE { Jenkinsfile } 
Prepare all the five steps which was shown in graphical interface using Jenkinsfile


Case - 2

Build the project 
Using “DOCKER”
When new changes are made in Source Code, jenkins should prepare new build i.e New Docker Image, which should have Tomcat and Newly Updated WAR file
HINT - Prepare Dockerfile accordingly

Kubernetes Cluster ?
Prepare Ansible Playbook, for setting up “PRODUCTION” grade kubernetes cluster, with 2 Nodes across two different availability zones

Deploy on Production Cluster - Kubernetes
When changes happen in source code, jenkins should prepare a new Docker build, which results in a new docker image
The newly generated docker image should be deployed on Kubernetes cluster, which means you need to prepare an Kubernetes Deployment with 2 replicas
Using a Service Object i(client) should be able to access the application i.e via Elastic Load Balancer
